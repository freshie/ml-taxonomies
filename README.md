# ml-taxonomies
A simple tool for managing taxonomies in marklogic

This project started as the Gospel topical explorer (GTE) which went into the GTE v2.0 (https://www.lds.org/gte20/) and is now being worked in a more generic taxonomy manager. The goal of this project is to showcase what improvements can be gained from having a taxonomy with your content. Since MarkLogic version 7 you can have both a triple store and a document store in the same database. This project is mostly focusing on the triple store but shows how those triples will help improve the discovery and enrichment of content.
